# idols - Oshi no Ko

These four servers are named after the four main characters of the mange/anime Oshi no Ko, they form a NixOS distributed building cluster,
I usually run the build command on `Ai` and nix will distribute the build to other three machines, which is convenient and fast.

When building some packages for riscv64 or aarch64, I often have no cache available because of various changes under the hood, so I need to build much more packages than usual, which is one of the reasons why the cluster was originally built, and another reason is distributed building is cool!
